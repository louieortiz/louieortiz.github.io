## about me 👨🏽‍💻

I've always been fascinated by how the fundamental elements of our world connect. In particular, most of my wonders piqued from an introductory computer science course. The assignments gave precedence to debugging and data structures, yet the burning question lay unanswered in my mind: “What do these lines of code mean to the human experience?” My personal microcosm always embraced technology, but I began to question how this abstract idea of the human mind impacted our relationship with the modern world.

I grew up in East Los Angeles, a predominantly low-income Latinx community
It wasn’t until studying Data Science at UC Berkeley that I was able to articulate my interests and put them in expedited motion. Through my pursuits, I have grounded myself in understanding the power of ethical technology and it’s role in STEM education.

## 🦕 What I've done before

Purus non enim praesent elementum facilisis. In aliquam sem fringilla ut. Hac habitasse platea dictumst vestibulum rhoncus est. Ut porttitor leo a diam sollicitudin.

Amet commodo nulla facilisi nullam vehicula ipsum a arcu. Venenatis urna cursus eget nunc. Dui accumsan sit amet nulla facilisi morbi tempus. Vitae ultricies leo integer malesuada nunc vel risus commodo viverra. Sem viverra aliquet eget sit amet tellus cras.

Sit amet tellus cras adipiscing enim eu turpis egestas pretium. Ipsum faucibus vitae aliquet nec. Ac auctor augue mauris augue neque gravida. Neque egestas congue quisque egestas.
