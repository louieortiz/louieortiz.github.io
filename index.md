## about me 👨🏽‍💻

I've always been fascinated by how the fundamental elements of our world connect. In particular, most of my wonders piqued from an introductory computer science course. The assignments gave precedence to debugging and data structures, yet the burning question lay unanswered in my mind: “What do these lines of code mean to the human experience?” My personal microcosm always embraced technology, but I began to question how this abstract idea of the human mind impacted our relationship with the modern world.

I grew up in East Los Angeles, a predominantly low-income Latinx community
It wasn’t until studying Data Science at UC Berkeley that I was able to articulate my interests and put them in expedited motion. Through my pursuits, I have grounded myself in understanding the power of ethical technology and it’s role in STEM education.
