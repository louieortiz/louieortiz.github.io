## about me üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª

I've always been fascinated by how the fundamental elements of our world connect. In particular, most of my wonders piqued from an introductory computer science course. The assignments gave precedence to debugging and data structures, yet the burning question lay unanswered in my mind: _What do these lines of code mean to the human experience?_ 

My personal microcosm always embraced technology, but I began to question how this abstract idea of the human mind impacted our relationship with the modern world. More specifically, how technological literacy and access contributes to the livelihood of marginalized populations.

Studying Data Science with a domain emphasis in Philosophy at UC Berkeley has allowed me to articulate these multifaceted interests. Through my pursuits, I have grounded myself in understanding the power of pratical technology and it‚Äôs role in STEM education.

## currently üí≠

I have fortified my passions in UC Berkeley‚Äôs Data Science community with a human-centered approach. I serve as a curriculum developer through the [Human Contexts and Ethics](https://data.berkeley.edu/hce) department, where I work with data science course staff to integrate educational material focused on ethics in a ‚Äúdatafied world.‚Äù I am also on the Undegraduate Advisory Board at the [D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/), funded by the [NSF IUSE grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1915714&HistoricalAwards=false), actively connecting with campus organizations to provide knowledge of Data Science related resources. Recently, I joined the [Anti-Racism Student Committee](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/bpe) in the College of Engineering to survey student concerns about the computer science department at Cal, in efforts to foster a more welcoming and equitable academic climate. 

In a different capacity, I volunteer as an advising fellow through [Matriculate](https://www.matriculate.org/apply), a non-profit supporting high school seniors through their college application process.

## technical work üìä

My interdisciplinary background in Data Science has provided me with foundations in several cognate domains. I have taken coursework in computer science, statistics, and mathematics, complemented with the humanistic fields of philosophy, sociology, and psychology. 

I have excelled in technical projects in machine learning, data engineering, and statistical modeling, which can be viewed in my [project portfolio](https://github.com/louieortiz/projects).
